# Welcome to the hifi-link native app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Timers

The Timers tab integrates with backend endpoints:

- GET /timers — list active timers
- POST /timers — create a persisted timer
- POST /timers/test — fire a one-off timer (not persisted)
- DELETE /timer?id=<id> — delete a persisted timer

Configure the device IP/API key under Settings. The app caches the timers list locally and polls every 5 seconds to keep countdowns fresh. Creating a timer computes delay_minutes from the selected type (sleep uses the minutes; wakeup computes minutes until the specified HH:mm, rolling to the next day if necessary).
