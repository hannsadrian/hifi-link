# hifi-link üíø‚ö°Ô∏èüìÄ

Since the 1980s, many amplifiers, receivers, tape decks, cd players and even some turntables come with remote controls. This is great for controlling the equipment from a distance. However, there are some unsatisfying limitations: range, obstacles blocking the signal and more.

Naturally, every manufacturer has a different remote. On some hifi systems, only the receiver has an infrared sensor and signals are only passed down the line using cables. On newer systems, APIs exist, already connecting the device over the network.

The aim of hifi-link is to enable the implementation of many different protocols and to provide an environment along with configuration and user interface.

Nowadays, the remotes we all have universally available are our phones. What if we could bring all old hifi remotes into a singular system remote, fully configurable and with advanced functionalities right in our pocket?

That is what **hifi-link** is all about.

    
### Features at a Glance

*   üì± **Unified Remote:** Control all your devices from a single, modern interface.
*   üåê **Network Control:** Operate your Hi-Fi gear over Wi-Fi, breaking free from line-of-sight limitations.
*   üß† **Universal Learning:** Teach `hifi-link` any IR remote with the built-in learning mode.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Multi-Protocol Hub:** Natively supports IR, with an extensible architecture for wired protocols (e.g., Kenwood XS8, SL16) and network APIs.
*   üîß **Customizable UI:** Build the remote you've always wanted using a web-based interface editor.

## Hardware

Right now, the project is focused on the Raspberry Pi Pico W as it is a very cheap and wifi enabled microcontroller. 

The most basic functionality of hifi-link is imitating an infrared remote. To be able to send infrared signals with hifi-link, you only need an IR-LED, two resistors and a transistor like the 2N2222 or the 2N3904.
To capture the signals of you exisiting remote, you will need an additional TSOP38238 or something similar. (see `TODO: IR-Transceiver-Wiring.md`)

For cable driven protocols like Kenwoods XS8 or SL16, you can just tear an old 3.5mm audio cable apart and solder jumper wires at the end.

## Using hifi-link

When opening the hifi-link app or webpage for the first time, you'll be able to select connected devices and their protocols.

To be able to infrared control your equipment, it is probably easiest to teach hifi-link your existing remote. But it will be possible to control devices you do not have the physical remote for.

The nice part about hifi-link is that you will be able to configure the interface however you like, be it simple or advanced.

### Quick Start

1.  **Hardware:** Flash MicroPython onto a Pico W and assemble the simple IR transceiver circuit (see `TODO IR-Transceiver-Wiring.md`).
2.  **Firmware:** Copy the files from the `/firmware` directory to your Pico and add your Wi-Fi credentials in `secrets.py`.
3.  **App:** Run the frontend application from the `/app` directory (details in the app's README).
4.  **Teach & Play:** Use the app's "Teach" mode to learn your existing remotes, then control your gear!

## Contributing

If your device is not yet supported by the capabilities of hifi-link, I encourage you to implement the control protocol in hifi-link and contribute!
This way, hifi-link will be able to support a wide variety of devices.

### Technology Stack

*   **Firmware:** [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
*   **Backend API:** A lightweight web server running directly on the Pico.
*   **Frontend:** [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) for a cross-platform mobile and web app.
*   **Communication:** Simple REST API over HTTP.
